# Chatbot-Jerusalmi-Lascar
Chatbot Project for the Chatbot lecture

Passionate about geography, we decided to choose the theme of countries as the subject of our chatbot.


To use our Chatbot you have to :
    - enter in the directory of the project "cd /Path_of_the_Project ";
    
    - "npm install" ;
    
    - "node server.js" ;
    
    - connect the facebook developper app with the webhook and ngrok.
  
  
  Now you can talk with it !
